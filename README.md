Fractal Mobile Application SzTE Project


A long click (200ms) makes the panel go away and the fractal touchable. The same long click is necessary to return to the panel.
On the main panel there are radio buttons that switch between the attributes of the fractal the user can control with touch.
The "reset" button set the fractal back to its initial values.
The "center" button sets the position and rotation to 0 and the zoom to a default value.

The "gallery' button on the main panel leads to the Gallery Activity.
In the gallery, fractals can be selected from a slideshow and their values be represented up top.
The "load" button loads the selected fractal into the Main Activity.
The "back" button simply returns to the Main Activity, without loading any fractals.
The "delete" button removes the selected fractal.

The "options' button on the main panel leads to the Options Activity.
In the options, all of the fractal's values are editable via precise input.
With the "apply" button, the edited values can be loaded back into the Main Activity.
The "cancel" button simply returns to the Main Activity, without any edited values being loaded.
